Project made for WarsawJS front-end workshop. 

Gulp is not mandatory to use but for sure it will be easier to develop project with it.
## Initial setup
- Install node.js with npm (package manager). If you already have it installed move to the next step
- Run `npm install` in terminal
- Run `gulp` in terminal
- Start project with `npm start` - command should start dev server
